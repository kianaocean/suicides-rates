# suicides-rates
I conducted this analysis in March 2021 as my final project in my Programming R for Analytics class at Carnegie Mellon. The purpose of the assignment was to use R to analyze a dataset and to include commentary along with our analysis.

I chose to analyze the Suicide Rates Overview dataset, which contains worldwide suicide data from 1985-2016.
The data was found on Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016).
